This is the client implementation of the [Bestia Game](https://bestia-game.net).

Currently its meant as a development platform and as a small introduction game, thus currently no connection to the server
is established and it is solely a single user game. Later the server support will be added. The game is under active development
but I can only do so much. If you want to help in coding feel free to fork this repo and open some pull requests. :)

Documentation and Game Design goals can be found here in the [Bestia Developers Documentation](https://docs.bestia-game.net/).

Without this free artwork this game would not have been possible. Thanks to all artists! Please

## Created By

Created with :heart: by [Thomas Felix](https://tfelix.de).

The idea of this game is in my mind since 2006. It was meant as a little browsergame meant to be played by my highschool
class. Sadly it never came to a state which I was satisfied with. So the idea got dragged along and along and slowly
evolved into this game.

The first Alpha version screenshots looked like this and came from the release around 2009:

![Bestia Overview Screen](https://bestia-game.net/user/data/images/github/bestia_overview.jpg "Bestia Overview Screen")
![Inventory](https://bestia-game.net/user/data/images/github/inventory.jpg "Bestia Inventory")
![Moving Bestia in the overworld](https://bestia-game.net/user/data/images/github/move.jpg "Moving Bestia in Overview World")

Since then there was pause in development until I dreamed about new game mechanics and was complelty fed up with todays
MMORPGs. The idea of Bestia was renewed and development began to speed up again in 2016.
